Project Overview: Designing and Testing a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog using ModelSim Objective The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, simulate, and verify a Finite State Machine (FSM) using Verilog and ModelSim. The project aims to provide a practical understanding of FSM design in digital systems and demonstrate the use of hardware description languages (HDL) and simulation tools in the VLSI design process.

Key Activities FSM Design

The FSM's state diagram, including states and transitions, was defined. The states were encoded, and state transition logic was defined. FSM Implementation in Verilog

Verilog code was written to implement the FSM based on the defined state diagram. The code included state encoding, state registers, and next-state logic. Testbench Development

A Verilog testbench was written to simulate the FSM. A test sequence was developed to validate the FSMâ€™s behavior under various conditions. Simulation and Verification

ModelSim was used to compile and simulate the Verilog code. It was verified that the FSM transitions correctly between states as per the defined state diagram. Simulation waveforms were analyzed to ensure the FSM operates as expected. Detailed Description FSM Design State Diagram: The FSM was defined with states and transitions. For example, a 3-state FSM with states A, B, and C where: A transitions to B. B transitions to C. C transitions back to A. FSM Implementation in Verilog State Encoding: Binary codes were assigned to each state. Example: A = 2'b00 B = 2'b01 C = 2'b10 Testbench Development Clock Generation: A clock signal was created for simulation. Reset Initialization: A reset signal was applied to initialize the FSM. Test Sequence: A sequence of inputs and expected outputs was defined to test state transitions. Simulation and Verification Compile the Design: The Verilog code and the testbench were compiled using ModelSim. Run the Simulation: The testbench was executed in ModelSim to simulate the FSM. Verify Outputs: The simulation results and waveforms were checked to ensure the FSM transitions between states correctly. Outcomes The FSM was successfully designed and implemented in Verilog. A comprehensive testbench was developed to simulate and validate FSM behavior. The correct operation of the FSM was verified using ModelSim, ensuring it met the specified design criteria. Conclusion This project provided hands-on experience in digital design using Verilog, including FSM design, implementation, testing, and verification using simulation tools. Key concepts in HDL-based design and the practical application of simulation for verifying digital systems were reinforced.
